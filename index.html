  <p><em>Mechatronics Engineering Student at <a href="https://www.bilgi.edu.tr/en/"><strong>Istanbul Bilgi University</strong></a></<em>
  </p>
  <p><em>I am a second year student in mechatronics I enjoy learning new skills and trying out new things.
      I like to take on challenges. I like anything that has to do with cars and motors, I am a huge fan of
      driving anywhere anytime (yet I still have no lisence) but I am in the process of getting one. Because
      of this I would love to get a job in a huge car company such as Mercedes so that I can work on what I like.
      I also have a goal of attaining a better passport and succeding in providing for a beautiful family and
      provide for them in a better way than my father.</em><br>
